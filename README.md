###Rules:

Breakthrough is a two-player abstract strategy board game that was invented by Dan Troyka in 2000. The game is played on an 8x8 square board with each player having 16 pieces in the form of checkers, which are initially placed on opposite sides of the board.

The objective of the game is for one player to either get one of their pieces to the opposite side of the board or to capture all of the other player's pieces. The players take turns moving one of their pieces diagonally forward one square at a time, with the option to capture an opponent's piece by moving diagonally forward into a square occupied by an opponent's piece. Captured pieces are removed from the board.

A player may not move a piece backwards unless it has reached the opposite end of the board and is promoted to a "king" piece, which can move both forwards and backwards. In addition, a player may not make a move that would leave one of their pieces without any neighboring squares, unless it is a move that captures an opponent's piece.

The game of breakthrough is typically won through careful planning and strategic moves, as well as the ability to recognize and capitalize on your opponent's mistakes.
